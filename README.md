RxAppoint is a web application designed to improve the way patients control prescriptions along with setting medical appointments. It simplifies the entire process through the use of artificial intelligence in drug recommendations, and through the use of blockchain in securing medical records. The system has an intelligent chatbot that advises the patient on their prescription and makes it easy for him/her to understand and manage appointments. With React.js, we developed the front end, with Node.js the back end, and with MongoDB stored data. In our testing phase, we achieved 60% improvement in booking speed, the 92% accurate suggestions from the side of AI, and secure transmission of prescriptions, through the use of what we used in Blockchain, namely Ethereum and IPFS.
